# About

- At the end of 2023, Sam and Troy came up with a wild idea to create an online introductory tutorial on photography and videography. After a brief discussion, they submitted the first commit on Jan 8, 2024.

- After its launch, the tutorial quickly gained widespread acclaim. As technology evolved, Sam and Troy recognized the need to better align the content with readers' growing demands. On August 26, 2025, they decided to restructure the entire tutorial, adopting a process-oriented approach with hyperlinks to reorganize the materials. This overhaul comprehensively covered the entire workflow from imaging principles to capturing techniques and post-processing, while also adding a highly requested section on film photography. The revamped tutorial was completed and officially released on October 1, 2025.

- Jan 8, 2024 - Initial commit
- Oct 1, 2025 - Major content expansion and reader feedback integration launched
